# Before You Begin

In next sections, we will work you through an example of how to release an NEP-5 asset on Neo blockchain, which includes the tasks of setting up and configuring the development environment, compiling, deploying and invoking the smart contract on a private Neo chain.

Neo provides two full-node clients: NEO-GUI and NEO-CLI. This tutorial is based on the usage of Neo-CLI.

## System environment

Neo-CLI runs in the following environments:

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
- CentOS 7.4/7.6

### Download Neo-CLI

Refer to [Neo-CLI Setup](../../node/cli/setup.md) to download and install Neo-CLI Preview2 package from GitHub.

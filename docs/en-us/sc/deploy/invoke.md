# Invoking Smart Contracts

After you deployed a smart contract on the blockchain, you can then invoke it by its script hash, which is the unique identity of a smart contract. Any script changes in the contract will result in a different script hash.

## Querying the contract details

You can query a contract details using Neo-CLI or Neo-GUI, such as the contract general information, entry point, methods, notifications, etc. 

### Querying using Neo-CLI

Use the RPC API [getcontractstate method](../../reference/rpc/latest-version/api/getcontractstate.md) to query the contract information.

### Querying using Neo-GUI

1. In Neo-GUI click `Contract` ->`Search Contract`
2. Enter the contract script hash, click  `Search`.

The detailed contract information is displayed in Neo-GUI. You can also view the manifest and nef files.

## Invoking a contract

### Invoking a contract using Neo-CLI

You can choose one of the following ways to invoke the contract using Neo-CLI:

- Use the command invoke, which syntax is:

   ```
   invoke <scriptHash> <operation> [contractParameters=null]    [witnessAddress=null]
   ```

   For more information refer to [invoke](../../node/cli/cli.md#invoke).

- Use the RPC API [invokefunction](../../reference/rpc/latest-version/api/invokefunction.md) or [invokescript](../../reference/rpc/latest-version/api/invokescript.md). The former is recommended. 

### Invoking a contract using Neo-GUI

1. In Neo-GUI click `Contract `->`Invoke Contract`ã€‚

2. Enter the contract script hash and click `Search`.

   The methods and parameter list in the current contract are displayed.

3. Select the desired method, fill in the parameters and click `trial test`.

   The trial run at this step does not affect the blockchain as it is just create a NeoVM on your local computer to simulate the invocation.

4.  If the trial run goes smoothly and you want to invoke it on the blockchain, click `Invoke`.

## Cosignature

Some contracts require multiple signatures when invoked, one of which is the signature of the transaction initiator to support the fee, and the rest are cosignatures.

When writing a contract, we usually use `Runtime.CheckWitness (owner)` to authenticate the caller  address, where `owner` is the address allowed to be invoked, and the parameter type is `ByteArray`. Invoking the contract with an unspecified address will fail. For example, when updating a contract, the owner here is the contract administrator. When transferring assets, the owner here is the sender (payer).

When `Runtime.CheckWitness (owner)` is written in the contract, the owner's signature must be passed in as a cosignature when you invoke the contract. 

In Neo-CLI, you can attach a signature using the invoke command.

```
invoke <scriptHash> <operation> [contractParameters=null] [witnessAddress=null]
```

When invoking a contract in Neo-GUI, you can click `Cosignature` at the bottom of the page, choose `Public key`, and then click `Sign` to add the signature.  

> [!Note]
>
> When you invoke the transfer method of the NEP-5 contract using the transfer command, the wallet will automatically appends the signature to the from field. You don't need to add it manually.

## Invoking between contracts

In Neo3, all contracts can be invoked dynamically, and writing a contract is much easier.

```c#
public class Contract1 : SmartContract
{
    delegate object Dyncall(string method, object[] args);

    //Little endian of 0x230cf5ef1e1bd411c7733fa92bb6f9c39714f8f9
    //HexToBytes() and ToScriptHash() can only operate on constants and cannot be written in the Main method
    //scriptHash can also be passed in from parameters or read from storage
    static byte[] ScriptHash = "f9f81497c3f9b62ba93f73c711d41b1eeff50c23".HexToBytes();

    public static object Main(string operation, object[] args)
    {
        if (operation == "name")
        {
            return Contract.Call(ScriptHash, "name", new object[0]);
        }
        if (operation == "totalSupply")
        {
            return Contract.Call(ScriptHash, "totalSupply", new object[0]);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The key statement is `Contract.Call(scriptHash, method, params)`, where:

- scriptHash is the script hash of the contract invoked. It is ByteArray type and little endian.

- method is the method of the contract invoked, such as  `name`, `balanceOf`, or`transfer` . String type.

- params is the parameter list of the method of the invoked contract. Array type.

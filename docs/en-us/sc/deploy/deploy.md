# Deploying Smart Contracts

When a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it can be used by other users or invoked by other contracts. This section describes how to deploy and invoke the smart contract in the NEO blockchain using Neo-CLI or Neo-GUI. The instructions in this section are generic and applicable to all contract types including NEP-5 assets. 

## What contracts need to be deployed?

When a smart contract needs to store data or to be invoked by another smart contract (called appcall) on the blockchain, it needs to be deployed. Contracts triggered only by the verification trigger, such as the lock contract and multi-signature contract, do not need to be deployed as they will not be invoked by other contracts. Contracts such as  `return 1+1`  do not need to be deployed as they do not require any input parameters.

From the programming language perspective, only when a smart contract will be used as a class library, it needs to be deployed. For example: 

- When a smart contract has variable incoming parameters, it must serve as a storage. The caller (Invocation transaction) or other smart contracts provide the parameters.
- When a smart contract uses storage it must serve as a class library.
- When a smart contract implements NEP-5 standard assets, the contract needs to be deployed on the blockchain.

### How to deploy?

Smart contracts are deployed by invoking API through an Invocation transaction. Usually we use Neo-CLI or Neo-GUI to deploy smart contracts. 

Deploying and invoking smart contracts will cost fees. For more information, refer to [Fees](../fees.md).

## Before you start
Make sure you have done the following:

- Confirmed that your contract should be deployed. 
- Compiled a contract file (\*.nef) and a descriptive file of contract (\*.manifest.json).
- Installed Neo-CLI or Neo-GUI and completed block synchronization. For more information, refer to  [Neo-CLI](../../node/cli/setup.md) and [Neo-GUI](../../node/gui/install.md)

## Deploying contract with Neo-CLI

In Neo-CLI run the following command to deploy your contract:

 `deploy <nefFilePath> [manifestFile]`

-  `<nefFilePath>` : mandatory. The contract file
- `[manifestFile]` : optional. The descriptive file of contract

### Example

```
deploy NEP5.nef
```

or

```
deploy NEP5.nef NEP5.manifest.json
```

After the command is executed, the program deploys the smart contract and pays the fee automatically.

```
neo> deploy NEP5.nef
Script hash: 0xb7f4d011241ec13db16c0e3484bdd5dd9a536f26
Gas: 3

Signed and relayed transaction with hash=0xe03aade81fb96c44e115a1cc9cfe984a9df4a283bd10aa0aefa7ebf3e296f757
```

### Common errors

`Engine faulted`

- Contract already exists
- .nef  is not matched with .manifest
- either .nef or .manifest is wrong
- Insufficient fee

## Deploying contracts with Neo-GUI

1. In Neo-GUI click `Contract` -> `Deploy Contract`ã€‚
2. Select the desired *.nef and *.manifest.json files.
3. Click `Deploy`.
